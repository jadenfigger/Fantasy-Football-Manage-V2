This application is a Fantasy Football Manager, where it allows the user to create and manage an entire league. 
This includes creating teams, adding players to those teams, creating a schedule to matchup teams against each other.
Then you can, with the press of a button, calculate point totals for those teams for the current week. The program also
allows you to view each fantasy week to see stats about the teams. Some of these stats include each teams record, average points 
scored per week, total points scored, and much more.
